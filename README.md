# political-socialisation
This repository contains the replication materials for the thesis 'Determinants and Mechanisms of Pre-Adult Political Socialisation within the Family: Evidence from Britain', submitted in partial fulfilment of the MPhil in Politics (Comparative Government) at the University of Oxford.

The thesis examines the process of political socialisation of party identity within families in Britain, using thirty years of data from the British Household Panel and the UK Household Longitudinal Survey. It finds support for classic findings of congruence in party identity between parents and children, which is enhanced by frequent, strong, and consistent partisan cues. However, it does not find support for the mechanisms that, according to social learning theory, drive political learning.
